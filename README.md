# Belfastbot

Belfastbot is a version of GitHub's Campfire bot, [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com). He's pretty cool.
This version is deployed on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), and sits in the ##belfast IRC channel on freenode.

Ping @cobyism [on twitter](https://twitter.com/cobyism) or on IRC if you have
a question about (or problem with) this thing.
